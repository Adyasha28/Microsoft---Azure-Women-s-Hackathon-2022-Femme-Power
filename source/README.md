This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

It has 4 sections:- Homepage, Cart Section, Checkout, Payment Gateway

Available Scripts
In the project directory, we can run:

npm install- To install the node modules

npm start-
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in our browser.

The page will reload when we make changes.
we may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test-
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build-
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Our app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject-
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once we eject, we can't go back!

If we aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, we can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from our project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into our project so we have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so we can tweak them. At this point we're on our own.

We don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and we shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if we couldn't customize it when we are ready for it.
