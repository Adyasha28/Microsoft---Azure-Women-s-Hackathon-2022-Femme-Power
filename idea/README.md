We have designed an app that will help to empower the local rural women to expand their traditional handicrafts and handloom culture that are being endangered with increased modernisation and industrialization.
It will help to build solutions to enable economic freedom for women.
Rural women who often went unnoticed because of backward culture and poverty will get recognition globally.
It will also help to eradicate unemployment problem for women.
Our App will help to restore the dying arts to their original glory as preserving and protecting the skills and knowledge of traditional crafts is a very important step in preserving the countryâ€™s rich heritage.
